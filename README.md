# Tokenizer

This is a 42 School project about learning the basics of Web3. I created my own ERC20 compliant personal token on the Sepolia Ethereum Blockchain. Programmed in Solidity, deployed using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

The token is called OogaBooga42 (OB42). Its contract is `0x140B99bD8D339f7EaA927A3750a515c7FCB352fb`. You can view all its transactions on [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x140b99bd8d339f7eaa927a3750a515c7fcb352fb).

Visit the documentation folder for more information about its usage.
